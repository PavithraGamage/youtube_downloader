# YouTube Downloader v1.0

## About

The software as it is now only supports Windows environments. The software is now in its first build for distribution, 
and it will be improved and given more functionality as time goes on. I believe you can give me useful comments to 
enhance the app. **Only 720p videos** are downloaded by the app. To download additional video streams, I would strive to 
make it better. There is no publisher certificate for this software. You could be having some problems with the virus 
defenders as a result. If you are confident in the program, you should temporarily turn off your computer's virus 
protection and add the file youtube_downloder.exe to the list of non-malware files.

## Known Issues

* The software has been bugged with high capacity and more duration videos. The UI came to not respond due to the long 
download time. If the download is completed the UI may run as usual.

## Installation

1. Download the Output folder in the root directory.
2. Disable the virus protectors. 
3. Simply run the youtube_downloder.exe.
